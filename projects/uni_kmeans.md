## K-means Clustering application on U.S. Universities

- A simple student project performed over a dataset of U.S. Universities by applying the k-means clustering algorithm. Initially, we analyzed the dataset by ignoring the data points with missing values. Later on, we estimated the missing values and applied further analysis based on the completed dataset. Both analyses ended in four clusters with specific characteristics: a cluster with top-class universities, a cluster with low-end universities, a cluster with low-cost and majorly public universities, and a cluster with slightly above average in most categories.
