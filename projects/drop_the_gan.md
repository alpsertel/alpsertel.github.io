## Implementation of the Paper: Drop the GAN: In Defense of Patches Nearest Neighbors as Single Image Generative Models - with Ege Demir

- The paper argues against the belief that GANs are superior to classical and rather unsophisticated patch-based methods for image manipulation tasks. The authors express that patch-based methods can be alternated to perform tasks that are considered as “GAN-only”, and even outperform GANs in terms of visual quality and application speed. They propose the adapted patch-patch based method GPNN (Generative Patch Nearest Neighbors) with several modifications. It is argued that the proposed model is able to generate diverse images from a single neutral image. The model outperforms GANs in terms of the visual quality of the output and the runtime of image generation (from hours to seconds).
